	"description": "If you haven't guessed already, my name is Mark and I am English. \n\n In 2017, my wife and I returned to France after many years in Asia. Since then, I have done different training courses to learn French and now I am ready for something new. \n\n Prior to moving to Asia, I studied system analysis and design, interface design and programming as part of my degree. Thus, I already have programming experience and can easily learn new software. I also like the visual and functional aspects of frontend development. \n\n In 2022 I completed a fourteen month training course in frontend development, receiving the RNCP level 6 (bac +4) recognized by the State (French government), which covered a wide range of topics. \n\n For example, I have (to name but a few): \n\n - given two mock-ups, one desktop and one mobile, integrated the content, according to the mock-ups, whilst Implement a responsive interface \n\n - ensured the graphic coherence of a web site, whilst Implementing advanced graphic CSS effects (i.e., animations) \n\n - made a registration form fully functional with all form field validation rules added using JavaScript. \n\n - created a website whilst following accessibility rules (WCAG compliant) \n\n - developed an efficient search algorithm \n\n - written unit & integration tests with JavaScript as well as producing a E2E plan \n\n - created a model for a client, identify the needs of the application from a specification & then modelled a technical solution for the customer (mock-ups, acceptance criteria & use case diagrams) \n\n - analysed the performance of a web application & then migrated from jQuery to React to reduce the technical debt \n\n - developed single page applications (SPA) using React & React Router… \n\n Since finishing my training I continue to learn & see that I have the skills and motivation for this domain and would very much like to develop this into a career… \n\n “What did I do previously?” you might ask… \n\n Well… \n\n For sixteen years I was a Dive Centre and Nautical Base Manager in various four and five-star hotels in the Maldives. \n\n I was responsible for all logistics, human resources, planning of team activities and maintenance of equipment. I was also responsible for the creation and distribution of the different advertising for the activities that were offered. \n\n Previously, I also taught people to dive, applying my passion for the sport, reacting quickly to ever-changing circumstances, whilst providing safety as well as fun. \n\n I can deal with people from all different backgrounds and ages, which means that I am sensitive to peoples’ needs and worries, whilst listening and finding solutions…",
