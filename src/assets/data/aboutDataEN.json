	"description": "If you haven't guessed already, my name is Mark and I am English.\n\n In 2017, my wife and I returned to France after many years in Asia. Since then, I have done different training courses to learn French and now I am ready for something new.\n\n Although it has been many years, I studied system analysis and design, interface design and programming as part of my degree. Thus, I already have some programming experience and can easily learn new software. I also like the visual and functional aspects of frontend development.\n\n Also, in my free time and for my work, I can easily stay in front of the computer for numerous hours (without any problem).\n\n For this reason, automatically I thought of a new career in the domain of web development.\n\n It was during my research that I found Openclassrooms who offer online courses in web development. Since then, I have spent several months, following their frontend development course learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React for example. \n\n Thus, I can see that I have the skills and motivation for this domain and would very much like to develop this into a career.\n\n “What did I do previously?” you might ask…\n\n Well…\n\n For sixteen years I was a Dive Centre and Nautical Base Manager in various four and five-star hotels in the Maldives.\n\n I was responsible for all logistics, human resources, planning of team activities and maintenance of equipment. I was also responsible for the creation and distribution of the different advertising for the activities that were offered. \n\n Previously, I also taught people to dive, applying my passion for the sport, reacting quickly to ever-changing circumstances, whilst providing safety as well as fun. \n\nI can deal with people from all different backgrounds and ages, which means that I am sensitive to peoples’ needs and worries, whilst listening and finding solutions…",
