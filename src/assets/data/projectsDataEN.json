			"notes":"This project is my first attempt at using both PHP & MySQL, gaining me a better understanding of both languages. But, there is always room for improvement... In the future, I would like to refactor the code to reflect the MVC model that I had not learnt during the creation of the project and there is some code repitition for the form validations due to mutliple forms. Also, at the time of writing, there were only 18 recipes in the database, so it would be good to add more... \n\n You can sign up or use the visitor's credentials below: \n\n email: guest@foodwishes.com Password: Password@321",

They also offer Luxury Yacht Charter and Guest Transfer Services from the airport to the resort through our sister company Best Yachts Maldives.

			"notes":"I have again used https://pantheon.io/ as the free hosting service. Unfortunately, I have read that there is always the possibility that the site is removed for no reason and using a free service and plugins means that features are possibily limited but this was the brief.\n\n I also found page caching plugins to speed up page loading has mixed results or is blocked by the service provider. Moving from the dev to live environment also removed these plugins, but I have still directed the user to the 'live' site...  Saying that, the site looks remarkable similar with the same functionality. \n\n As mentioned previously, I have only used free plugins for this projects. For example:  Complianz/GDPR Cookie consent,  Conditional Menus, Duplicate Page, Jetpack Boost, Ocean Extra, UpdraftPlus, Wordfence Security, WP Mail SMTP, WP-Optimize, WPForms Lite & Elementor Page Builder. Whilst it's still online, you can see the old website that this site was cloned from at: https://www.bestdivesmaldives.com/ \n\n",
